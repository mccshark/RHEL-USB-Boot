MAKING INSTALLATION USB MEDIA
Cut & Paste BASH script from https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Installation_Guide/sect-making-usb-media.html

You can use a USB drive instead of a CD or DVD to create bootable media for installing Red Hat Enterprise Linux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems and IBM Power Systems servers. The exact procedure varies depending on whether you want to perform it on a Linux or Windows system. You can create minimal boot media and full installation media using the same procedure; the only limitation is the capacity of the USB drive - it must have enough space to fit the entire image, which means roughly 350 MB for minimal boot media and 4.5 GB for full installation media.
